# Sales Prediction Using Python
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting future sales based on historical data. Accurate sales predictions are crucial for inventory management, resource allocation, and financial planning.

# Overview
The goal of this project is to build and evaluate different machine learning models to predict sales. The dataset includes features such as store location, product type, promotional activities, and historical sales data. The project leverages Python and various machine learning libraries to build the models.

# Project Structure
data/: Contains the dataset (sales data file.csv) used for training and testing the models.

notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, feature engineering, and model training.

models/: Saved machine learning models for future predictions.

src/: Source code for data processing, model training, and evaluation.
